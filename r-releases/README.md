# r-releases

[![status](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

`r-releases` is a community-curated [R universe](https://github.com/r-universe-org/help) of R packages which are distributed as tags and releases on GitHub. The GitHub repository at <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases> allows anyone to contribute their package releases to this universe.

Please note that `r-releases` is currently a concept, barely even a prototype. We hope to eventually use it for production purposes, but it is far from ready at the moment.

# How to install a package from `r-releases`

To install a package from `r-releases` (for example, `jsonlite`), open R and run:

```r
install.packages("jsonlite", repos = "https://r-releases.r-universe.dev")
```

# How to add your package

To add your package to `r-releases`, first put your package in a GitHub or GitLab repository. Then, open a [GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases.r-universe.dev> to add one or more text files to the [`packages` folder](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages) of <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases>. The name of each file should be the package name, and the only contents of the file should be the URL of the package. See the [`packages` folder](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages) folder for examples.

# How to edit or remove packages

To edit or remove one or more packages, submit a pull request to edit the files in the  [`packages` folder](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages).

# What happens next

Every hour, a GitHub Actions workflow from <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases.r-universe.dev> combs through the pull requests at <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/pulls> and automatically merges the ones that add new packages with correct-looking URLs. Pull requests that cannot be automatically merged are either closed or flagged for manual review. 

Also every hour, another GitHub Actions workflow in <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases.r-universe.dev> collects all the packages and URLs from the [`packages` folder](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages) folder and builds the `packages.json` file for the R universe at <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases.r-universe.dev>. It uses the `"branch": "*release"` field in the JSON file so that each new GitHub tag and release sends the build to the universe. Development versions are not tracked.

Once your package is in `packages.json`, each new GitHub tag and release you create will publish your package to <https://r-releases.r-universe.dev> so others can install it. Please visit <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases.r-universe.dev> and <https://r-releases.r-universe.dev> for progress and status updates on your package.
